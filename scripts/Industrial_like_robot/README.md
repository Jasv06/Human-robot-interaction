# Industrial-like robot 
### Overview
Inside this folder unlike the demonstrator folder you will find 4 different scripts that are able to control the robot. The scripts that will help you control the robot are the following: 
- The robot_control_industrial.py file which will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position and make him follow your hand until it is stable and then drop the object in it. 
- The robot_control_industrial_2.py file which will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position, check whether your hand is stable or not and then drop the object in it. 
- The robot_control_industrial_3.py file which will help you make the robot pick multiple objects from different positions showing the different ways the reactor-x 150 can pick up objects and follow your hand until it is stable and drop the object/objects.
- Lastly, the robot_control_industrial_4.py file will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position, determining whether your hand is a suitable place to drop the object and then follow your hand until it is stable and drop the object.
