# Industrial-like robot 
## Overview
Inside this folder unlike the demonstrator you will find 4 different scripts that are able to control the robot. The robot_control_indsutrial.py file will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position and then make him follow your hand until it is stable and then drop the object in it. The robot_control_indsutrial_2.py file will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position, check whether your hand is stable or not and then drop the object in it. The robot_control_indsutrial_3.py file will help you make the robot pick multiple objects from different positions showing the different ways the reactor-x 150 can pick up objects and follow your hand until it is stable and drop the object/objects. Lastly, the robot_control_indsutrial_4.py file will help you make the robot pick an object from a predetermined position, determining whether your hand is a suitable place to drop the object and follow your hand until it is stable and then drop the object in it if your hand was a suitable place to drop the object.
